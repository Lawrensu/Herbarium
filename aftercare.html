        <h3><strong>The Care and Conservation of Herbarium Specimens</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Herbarium specimens can be damaged over time due to factors like natural disasters, poor storage conditions, irresponsible handling, breakdown of preparation processes, and insect damage.
          The RBGE Herbarium is responsible for ensuring the safety and security of its collection. To prevent specimen loss or damage, stringent storage and handling procedures are followed, and the collection's condition is checked and repaired according to conservation standards.
        </p>

      <!-- Section for Safety Storage Environment -->
      <section>
        <h3><strong>Safety Storage Environment</strong></h3>
        <p>
          The herbarium collection is stored in a secure, purpose-built facility with a stable environment of 20°C and 50% relative humidity to protect sensitive plant material. Metal storage cabinets with rubber door seals safeguard specimens from light, dust, and insects.
          Herbarium beetles (Trogoderma angustum) and biscuit beetles (Stegobium paniceum) can harm collections if not controlled. We use integrated pest management (IPM) techniques instead of harmful pesticides.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Freezing arriving specimens to -29°C for 5 days before entering the Herbarium</li>
          <li>Ensuring proper storage conditions</li>
          <li>Monitoring for insect activity</li>
          <li>Providing staff training and information</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Section for Handling Guidelines -->
      <section>
        <h3><strong>Handling Guidelines</strong></h3>
        <p>Proper handling minimizes the risk of physical damage to specimens.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep specimens horizontal and flat when handling. Hold both sides of the sheet and place them on a sheet of cardboard.</li>
          <li>Stack and unstack specimens carefully, avoiding shuffle. Always keep the plant facing upwards.</li>
          <li>Never place any object on a specimen. When not in use, cover specimens to protect them from sunlight, dust, wind, and moisture.</li>
          <li>If a specimen is left out of a cabinet, cover it with a cardboard sheet.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Section for Condition Surveying -->
      <section>
        <h3><strong>Condition Surveying</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Older specimens may have been housed in poor conditions or damaged due to improper handling. A condition survey was conducted during imaging and databasing mounted specimens to discover damage and prioritize repairs.
        </p>
        <p>Common problems identified include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Non-archival materials (cellophane, sellotape, and polythene)</li>
          <li>Surface dirt and pesticide stains</li>
          <li>Loose attachments</li>
          <li>Insect damage</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><strong>Repairs</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Our specimen restoration processes use archival materials and reversible procedures. Consult a professional conservator when treating historically or culturally important specimens. The following table lists common problems and recommended conservation treatments.

            <td>Use a 'smoke sponge' or soft brush to clean without damaging the specimen.</td>
